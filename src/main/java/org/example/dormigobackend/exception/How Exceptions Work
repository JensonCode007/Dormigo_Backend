1. Exception thrown in Service:
   throw new ResourceNotFoundException("Product", "id", 999);

2. Spring catches exception:
   "Oh, a ResourceNotFoundException was thrown!"

3. Spring looks for matching @ExceptionHandler:
   "Does GlobalExceptionHandler have a method for this?"

4.  Finds matching handler:
   @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
   "Yes! This method handles ResourceNotFoundException!"

5. Executes handler method:
   - Creates ErrorResponse object
   - Sets status = 404
   - Sets message = "Product not found with id: '999'"
   - Sets timestamp = current time
   - Sets path = "/api/products/999"

6. Returns response to frontend:
   HTTP 404 with JSON:
   {
     "status": 404,
     "message": "Product not found with id: '999'",
     "timestamp": "2024-01-15 14:30:45",
     "path": "/api/products/999"
   }
